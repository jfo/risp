this is a comment, since it is outside of any form, weird!

(this is a list)

(lists can have (lists) as members)

(they can (be (of (any nested ( depth)))))

(and be in (((head))) position)

((like) this)

(newlines

,
and
commas,
(for some reason, I might take that out)
are

ignored
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
)

and (numbers 1 2 3 are strings right now)

(e(v(e(r(y(t(h(i(n(g is a string right now))))))))))

and nothing has been eval'd yet.

(but 


neat though huh?

and look, here is the debugged pointer stuff for the structures!)
